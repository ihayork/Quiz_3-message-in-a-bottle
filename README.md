# Message in a Bottle

The content I created is a shine sprite from Super Mario Sunshine. I placed it at the intersection of Rumsey Rd. and Kilgour Rd. in Leaside.

There are four shines. The first one has not been modified. The second shine sits above the main one.

The third shine is in front of the main one, rotated in all axis. The fourth shine is half the size of the main one, sitting behind it and rotated in the x axis.

The exact values for changes in position, scale, and rotation for each model is commented in the html document.

The coordinates to the shines are: -79.371815 longitude and 43.717992 latitude.


I tried to add functionality to click on the model and get an alert with the location, but I wasn't able to get it to work.
